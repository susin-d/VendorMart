# VendorMate - Simplified Vercel Deployment

## Issue Resolution

The runtime error was caused by attempting to deploy serverless API functions. Since this requires a more complex setup, I've simplified the deployment to focus on the frontend-only approach.

## Current Configuration

Your `vercel.json` now deploys as a static React app that will:
- Build the frontend with `npm run build`
- Serve all routes through the React app
- Handle API calls through your existing backend or external services

## Deployment Options

### Option 1: Static Frontend Only (Current Setup)
- Deploys the React frontend to Vercel
- You'll need a separate backend service for APIs
- Good for: Frontend-only with external APIs

### Option 2: Full-Stack Alternative Platforms
For the complete VendorMate experience with backend APIs, consider:

1. **Railway.app** (Recommended)
   ```bash
   # Connect GitHub repo to Railway
   # Set DATABASE_URL environment variable
   # Deploy automatically
   ```

2. **Render.com**
   ```bash
   # Build Command: npm run build
   # Start Command: npm start
   # Add DATABASE_URL environment variable
   ```

3. **Fly.io**
   ```bash
   fly launch
   fly secrets set DATABASE_URL="your_database_url"
   fly deploy
   ```

## Current Vercel Deployment Steps

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Import project in Vercel dashboard
3. Deploy (will build React frontend only)
4. Your frontend will be live at `https://your-project-name.vercel.app`

## Next Steps

Choose your deployment strategy:
- **Frontend only**: Current Vercel setup works
- **Full-stack**: Switch to Railway, Render, or Fly.io for complete functionality

The database connection and API features require a platform that supports persistent backend services.
